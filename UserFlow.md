# Use Case and User Flow of P2L (Play2Learn)  

## Use Case  

P2L is a gamified educational platform designed to teach Universal Profile (UP) users about cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 concepts in an engaging and rewarding way. By integrating with Universal Profiles on the LUKSO blockchain, P2L leverages decentralized identity to provide a seamless, secure, and personalized learning experience. The mini dApp targets beginners and enthusiasts who want to deepen their understanding of Web3 while earning tokens and badges as rewards for their progress. It fosters community engagement by connecting learners with like-minded individuals, making education both fun and socially interactive.  

## User Flow  

### Onboarding and Wallet Connection  
1. A user visits the P2L dApp and is prompted to connect their Universal Profile using a compatible wallet (e.g., Universal Profile Browser Extension).  
2. The dApp uses EIP-6963 provider detection to identify available wallets and prioritizes LUKSO’s Testnet (Chain ID: 4021) for a seamless connection.  
3. Upon successful connection, the user’s UP address is displayed in the header (truncated for privacy), confirming their decentralized identity.  

### Exploring Benefits  
- The homepage showcases the benefits of P2L, including learning Web3 through games, earning rewards, and connecting with others.  
- Users are encouraged to dive into the quiz game to start their learning journey.  

### Playing the Quiz Game  
- Users navigate to the quiz section, where they encounter a card-based interface with Web3-related questions (e.g., blockchain basics, smart contracts, or LUKSO-specific topics).  
- Each question has multiple-choice options, and users select an answer within a 60-second timer.  
- Real-time feedback highlights correct/incorrect answers with visual cues (green for correct, red for incorrect), and users earn 100 points per correct answer.  
- The game cycles through questions, displaying them on three interactive cards, keeping the experience dynamic and engaging.  

### Reviewing Performance  
- When the timer expires, users are shown a "Victory" screen with their total score, number of questions answered, and a breakdown of correct and incorrect responses.  
- Incorrect answers are detailed with the user’s choice and the correct answer, reinforcing learning.  

### Earning Rewards  
- Based on their performance, users earn tokens or badges tied to their Universal Profile (e.g., ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens on LUKSO, pending smart contract integration).  
- These rewards are stored in their UP, enhancing their digital identity with proof of knowledge and participation.  

### Community Engagement  
- Users can share their achievements or connect with others through a community feature (e.g., a leaderboard or social hub, planned for future iterations).  
- The dApp encourages networking among UP users, fostering a sense of belonging in the Web3 ecosystem.  

### Disconnecting  
- Users can disconnect their Universal Profile from the header at any time, ensuring control over their identity and data.  

## Unique Value for Universal Profile Users  

### Personalized Learning with Decentralized Identity  
P2L integrates directly with Universal Profiles, allowing users to authenticate and interact using their LUKSO-based decentralized identity. This ensures a secure, user-owned experience where learning progress and rewards are tied to their UP, enhancing their digital identity with verifiable credentials.  

### Gamified Education Tailored for Web3  
Unlike traditional learning platforms, P2L gamifies Web3 education with interactive quizzes and a card-based UI, making complex topics like blockchain and LUKSO’s ecosystem accessible and fun. UP users gain practical knowledge they can apply to manage their profiles or engage in the LUKSO network.  

### On-Chain Rewards  
Rewards earned in P2L (tokens or badges) are linked to the user’s Universal Profile, leveraging LUKSO’s blockchain for transparency and ownership. This adds tangible value to their UP, as these assets can potentially be used in other LUKSO dApps or ecosystems (e.g., for governance, access, or trading).  

### Community Building on LUKSO  
P2L encourages UP users to connect with others in the LUKSO community, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing. By tying interactions to UPs, the dApp creates a trusted environment where users can network without compromising privacy.  

### LUKSO-Native Experience  
Built with LUKSO’s Testnet in mind, P2L aligns with the Universal Profile standard, offering a native experience that showcases the power of LUKSO’s blockchain. It educates users about UP-specific features (e.g., profile management, asset ownership) while they learn broader Web3 concepts.  

### Accessibility and Engagement  
The dApp’s responsive design ensures UP users can learn on any device, while the timer-based quiz format keeps them engaged. Real-time feedback and performance reviews cater to different learning styles, making P2L a versatile tool for the LUKSO community.  

In summary, P2L provides Universal Profile users with a unique blend of education, gamification, and community engagement, all anchored in the security and interoperability of LUKSO’s blockchain. By tying learning outcomes and rewards to UPs, it empowers users to grow their Web3 knowledge and digital presence in a meaningful, decentralized way.
